# TelegramBackup updates to the version 5.2!
## What's new?

1. This version should fix `RPCError 406: UPDATE_APP_TO_LOGIN` due to very old Telethon build;
2. This version adds new hidden mode: `P`, which on use will launch Python interpreter with TGBACK `globals()`. Can be useful for experienced users;
3. This version **has the first 64bit Windows executable build on latest Python**. It means that this build is **Windows10+ 64bit only** now. You **can** build your own executable on **any** system with any Python(3.7+) you want. **See README** file for guide if you really need this.
