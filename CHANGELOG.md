# TelegramBackup updates to the version 5.0!
## What's new?

The five-dot-zero is totally about small improvements of old and strange things that was bothering me a lot of time

0. **App tree & module names was changed**;
1. **Totally removed async/await from code**;
2. **Useless ReedSolomon error correction was removed**;
3. **More flat and simple (yet secure) encryption**;
4. **Changed backup structure to fit 2. & 3.**;
5. **All QR features is now optional**;
6. **Pure-Python code, due to the 5.**;
7. **Much simpler install process**;
8. **Refresh backup every 3 months** (was **2**);
9. Other minor improvements.

###### _You can't use 4.X backups with 5.X version. This update isn't critical, so you can destroy 4.X and make a 5.X backup whenever you want. Still, i highly recommend you to move to 5.X as soon as possible._
