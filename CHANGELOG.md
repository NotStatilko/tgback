# TelegramBackup updates to version 4.0!
## What's new?

1. **Scrypt**. Now scrypt is used for generating keys from passwords. Scrypt in Tgback uses 1GB of RAM, so be careful.

2. **TgbackAES**. Now TgbackAES generates IV on moment of encryption, not of initialization.

3. **Help page**. Now you can get help and F.A.Q directly in tgback.

###### _Backups of the new version **isn't** compatible with the old ones backups of tgback v3.X_
